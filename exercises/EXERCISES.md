# Exercises

## Philosophy

Why have exercises as a part of the course, as opposed to just further lecture?

* Working actively with the material will help you to better understand it, find good questions to ask, and be better prepared for the next sections.

Why have a lab as a part of the course, as opposed to just working on your own time? 

*  Opportunity to collaborate in groups.
* Get real-time feedback from instructors.
